## Welcome! 
😁 My name is Soren. I'm a Data Analyst by trade. I'm always learning more about Data Science and I'm hoping to gain more experience with Software Development as well this year.

🌱 I like chess and soccer. I'm hoping to do some soccer analytics in the near future, but for now find me on [Lichess](https://lichess.org/@/NurseDrunkenstein) and [Chess.com](https://www.chess.com/member/sorenfukboi).
